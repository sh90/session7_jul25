    ##Step 2: write_task
    #Agent: writer
    #
    #Input: It gets:
    #
    #The original input (e.g., topic)
    #
    #The output from research_task via the context parameter
    #
    #The agent uses the context (i.e., the research findings) to generate a blog post
write_task = Task(

# and to pass outputs forward when referenced.

# Assemble the crew
