# # What Is This Code Doing?
# # It defines a set of agents (roles in a newsroom) and assigns them tasks that together simulate the process of writing, editing, and publishing a news article.
# #
# # The overall structure is:
# # Reporter → Fact Checker → Copy Editor → SEO Expert → Publisher → Editor
#| Agent            | Purpose                                      | Delegation |
#| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
#| **Reporter**     | Writes the initial article based on a topic  |  Yes      |
#| **Fact Checker** | Verifies claims and accuracy of that article |  No       |
#| **Copy Editor**  | Fixes grammar/style issues in the article    |  No       |
#| **SEO Expert**   | Optimizes the article for search engines     |  No       |
#| **Publisher**    | Publishes the finalized article              |  No       |
#| **Editor**       | Final review and approval for quality        |  Yes      |
